A new WordPress WooCommerce plugin that helps you to have sequential order numbers rather than random ones.

== Description ==
The plugin helps you to find highest order id if there is some existing orders and counts the order number sequentially after highest order id.
The plugin helps you to count the order numbers sequentially from One(1) if there is no existing orders.

The plugin helps you to set order number manually what you desire.

The plugin helps you to add suffix, prefix, hash(#) with the order number. For WooCommerce 2.2 or older: This will display a hash (#) before order numbers on the frontend and admin. But WooCommerce 2.3 or newer from the plugin settings, as WooCommerce core automatically displays a hash for all order numbers.

You may include the current day, month, or year in your custom order number prefix or suffix and may include the current time: hour, minute, second in your custom order number prefix or suffix.

You can set a custom order number size and enable order number size including prefix and suffix. If you enable order number size including prefix and suffix the order number size will be calculated including prefix length and suffix length.

Orders with only free products can be excluded from the paid order sequence for accounting purposes, and assigned their own custom prefix.
